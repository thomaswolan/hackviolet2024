# Lumina Loans - Microloan and Grant Finder App

## Inspiration

Our inspiration for Lumina Loans sprang from the resilience and determination of women entrepreneurs who have faced significant obstacles in accessing financial resources. Witnessing their struggles firsthand ignited our passion to create a platform that empowers these ambitious businesswomen to overcome financial barriers and realize their full potential.

## What it does

Lumina Loans connects women entrepreneurs with essential financial resources, including micro-loans and grants, to foster growth and economic diversity. Our platform offers a streamlined, accessible way for women to find tailored financial support for their businesses.

## How we built it

We developed Lumina Loans using a combination of front-end technologies such as React.js and Bootstrap CSS, with Python and BeautifulSoup4 for backend development and web scraping. This mix allowed us to efficiently gather and display a wide array of financial opportunities.

## Challenges we ran into

Navigating the complexities of accurate data collection and creating a user-friendly interface posed significant challenges. Ensuring our platform met the specific needs of women-owned small businesses required innovative solutions and adaptability.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Successfully bridging technology with finance to provide a valuable resource for women entrepreneurs is our key achievement. Our platform not only simplifies the search for financial resources but also champions the growth of women-owned businesses.

## What we learned

This project deepened our understanding of the financial barriers faced by women entrepreneurs and the power of technology to overcome these challenges. It also highlighted the importance of resilience and innovation in developing solutions that have a real-world impact.

## What's next for Lumina Loans - Microloan and Grant Finder App

We are committed to continuously improving Lumina Loans by expanding our database of financial resources, enhancing user experience, and integrating more personalized features to better serve women entrepreneurs across the globe. We also want to connect our software with bank API software, as well as find benefactors to help fund the start of developing our web app to a better position.
